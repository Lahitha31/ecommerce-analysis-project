## 📊 Visualizations

### Monthly Revenue

This line chart shows how revenue changes over time. Seasonal spikes are visible in Q4, reflecting holiday shopping patterns. Tracking monthly trends helps forecast demand and optimize stock.

---

### Category-wise Sales

![Category Sales](images/category_sales.png)

This bar chart compares total sales across product categories. Electronics and Home categories contribute the most revenue in the current dataset, indicating where marketing and stock should focus.

---

### Return Rates

This visualization highlights return behavior across categories. For example, Apparel shows a significantly higher return rate — consistent with known sizing/fit issues in real-world retail.

## 💡 Business Insights

- **Seasonal Trends:** Sales peaked during the holiday season, supporting increased marketing and inventory allocation around that time.
- **Category Strength:** A few categories dominate sales, meaning businesses can double down on high performers while improving or phasing out underperformers.
- **Return Problem Areas:** Return rates were highest in Apparel, suggesting the need for better sizing tools, photos, or quality control.
- **Data-Driven Value:** The project shows how simple analytics pipelines can lead to real, quantifiable business improvements.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Add customer segmentation and demographic layers
- Implement forecasting models (Prophet, ARIMA)
- Deploy interactive dashboards (Tableau, Dash)
- Integrate with external sales APIs or real datasets
