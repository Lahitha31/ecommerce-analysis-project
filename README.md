# Brazilian E-Commerce Data Analysis (Olist)

# E-Commerce Data Analysis Project

This project explores and analyzes a real-world e-commerce dataset (Brazilian Olist dataset) using an end-to-end modular pipeline. It focuses on simulating a data engineer's workflow from data ingestion, transformation, KPI reporting, cohort analysis, and dashboard-ready visualizations.

## Key Features

- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Simulates ingestion → transformation → analysis → reporting.
- **KPI Analysis**: Tracks top categories, payment methods, customer states, and revenue trends.
- **Cohort Analysis**: Understands user retention and lifecycle behavior over time.
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Calculates delivery time, delay, order value category, etc.
- **Visualizations**: Uses Seaborn, Plotly, and Matplotlib for meaningful business insights.

##  How to Run

1. Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Execute the pipeline:
   ```bash
   python etl_pipeline.py
   ```

3. Open and explore analysis notebooks:
   - `analysis/kpi_analysis.ipynb`
   - `analysis/visual_analysis.ipynb`
   - `analysis/cohort_analysis.ipynb`
