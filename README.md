# ecommerce-analysis-project

This project analyzes simulated e-commerce order data to generate actionable business insights. Using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, it creates visualizations for key metrics like monthly revenue trends, category-wise sales, and return rates. The findings aim to help stakeholders identify growth opportunities and address potential issues for better decision-making.

## üìå Project Description

This repository contains the analysis notebook (`ecommerce_analytics_clean_final.ipynb`) for a synthetic e-commerce dataset of 10,000+ orders. It walks through a full analytics pipeline: ETL simulation, feature engineering, KPI calculation, visualization, and time-series forecasting ‚Äî all aligned with real-world data analytics and data engineering practices.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

- **Google Colab (Recommended):**
  - Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
  - Upload the notebook `ecommerce_analytics_clean_final.ipynb`
  - Run all cells ‚Äî no installation required

- **Local Setup (Optional):**
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib plotly statsmodels
  jupyter notebook
  ```

## üìä Visualizations

### Monthly Revenue

![Monthly Revenue Trend](images/revenue_trend.png)

Interactive line chart showing monthly revenue patterns by category. Helps detect seasonal trends and plan inventory and marketing efforts.

---

### Category-wise Sales

![Category Sales](images/category_sales.png)

Horizontal bar chart comparing average order value across categories. Indicates which product groups generate high-value purchases.

---

### Return Rates

![Return Rate](images/return_rate.png)

Highlights which categories have high return rates. Useful for identifying product quality issues or user experience friction points.

---

### Segment-wise Performance

Revenue and behavior are compared across simulated customer segments: **Budget**, **Premium**, and **Occasional**. KPIs include:
- Total Revenue
- Average Order Value
- Return Rate
- Average Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

---

### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

CLV is estimated by simulating repeat purchases. The segment with the highest CLV can guide loyalty programs and targeted campaigns.

---

### Revenue Forecast

Uses ARIMA to forecast revenue for the next 6 months. The model is trained on historical monthly revenue data and visualized alongside real trends.

## üí° Business Insights

- **High-Revenue Periods:** Holiday months show spikes in revenue, supporting increased promo budgets during Q4.
- **Category Optimization:** Electronics and Home & Kitchen outperform others; Apparel has high returns.
- **Segment Strategy:** Premium customers yield higher CLV. Tailoring experiences for them could boost retention.
- **Predictive Power:** Time-series forecasting enables proactive planning.

## üöÄ Next Steps

- Add demographics or location-based filtering
- Enable real-time pipeline using external APIs or batch uploads
- Deploy visual dashboards via Dash or Tableau Public
- Train segmentation models using clustering
