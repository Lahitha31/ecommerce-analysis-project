# Brazilian E-Commerce Data Analysis (Olist)

# E-Commerce Data Analysis Project

This project explores and analyzes a real-world e-commerce dataset (Brazilian Olist dataset) using an end-to-end modular pipeline. It focuses on simulating a data engineer's workflow from data ingestion, transformation, KPI reporting, cohort analysis, and dashboard-ready visualizations.
