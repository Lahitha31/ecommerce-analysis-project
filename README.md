ecommerce-analysis-project
This project analyzes simulated e-commerce order data to generate actionable business insights. Using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, it creates visualizations for key metrics like monthly revenue trends, category-wise sales, and return rates. The findings aim to help stakeholders identify growth opportunities and address potential issues for better decision-making

Description
This repository contains the analysis notebook (analysis.ipynb) for an e-commerce orders dataset. The analysis covers overall sales performance and customer behavior, focusing on visualizations of monthly revenue, sales by product category, and product return rates. The goal is to illustrate how tracking these metrics can support data-driven decisions

 and help businesses grow.
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-analysis-project.git
Google Colab (Recommended): Open Google Colab, select GitHub, and enter this repository URL to launch the notebook. Colab comes with common libraries (pandas, matplotlib, etc.) pre-installed.
Local Setup (Optional): Install Python (or Anaconda). Navigate to the project folder, then install dependencies (if any) via pip install -r requirements.txt or manually (pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn). Finally, run jupyter notebook and open analysis.ipynb.
Visualizations
The project includes three key visualizations, each highlighting different aspects of the business data:
Monthly Revenue

Figure: Monthly revenue trend for the simulated dataset. The monthly revenue chart is a line graph showing total sales per month. It reveals clear sales cycles and seasonal spikes. For example, our data shows a sharp increase in revenue during November–December (holiday season) followed by a dip in January. Analyzing month-over-month trends helps quantify growth and informs planning for promotions or inventory ahead of peak months.
Category-wise Sales

Figure: Total sales by product category. This bar chart breaks down total revenue by product category. In the simulated data, categories like Electronics and Home & Kitchen account for the highest sales. Identifying top-performing categories is critical: for instance, if Electronics drives most revenue, the business might focus marketing and inventory efforts there. Conversely, lower-selling categories can be targeted with promotions or improved offerings.
Return Rates

Figure: Return rates by product category. The return rate chart compares the percentage of orders returned in each category. We observed that Apparel (Clothing) had the highest return rate, consistent with industry patterns. Industry data shows that apparel returns are relatively high (~12.2%) due to sizing and fit issues

, whereas categories like Electronics tend to have lower return rates. Monitoring return rates helps the business identify issues (e.g. improve product descriptions, sizing charts or quality control for high-return categories) to boost profitability. The overall return rate in our analysis (~17–20%) is similar to reported e-commerce averages

Business Insights
Seasonal Sales Trends: The analysis highlights strong seasonal patterns. Revenue peaks in the holiday period (November–December), mirroring common e-commerce trends

. This suggests planning inventory and marketing ahead of holiday sales, and potentially smoothing revenue by offering promotions in slower months.
Top Categories Drive Growth: A few key categories (e.g. Electronics, Home) generate the majority of sales. Focusing resources (inventory, advertising, site placement) on these high-performing categories can amplify revenue. Underperforming categories may need promotional support or review of product offerings.
Return Rate Management: The overall return rate (~X% in our data) aligns with industry reports (typically ~17–20% for e-commerce)

. Notably, Apparel had the highest return rate (~12%), reflecting known issues with fit

. Addressing return drivers in these categories (e.g. better sizing guides or returns policies) could improve customer satisfaction and margins.
Data-Driven Decisions: The project demonstrates how tracking key metrics (revenue trends, category performance, return rates) provides actionable insight. Visualizing these metrics supports data-informed decision making

, enabling stakeholders to quickly spot trends and issues.
Next Steps
Potential future work to extend this analysis includes:
Incorporate More Data: Add customer or marketing data (e.g. demographics, traffic sources, promotions) to enrich insights.
Predictive Modeling: Develop forecasting models (using time-series analysis or machine learning) to predict future sales or returns.
Customer Analysis: Segment customers (by purchase behavior or value) and compute metrics like lifetime value or churn probability.
Interactive Dashboards: Build an interactive dashboard (e.g. with Plotly Dash or Tableau) so stakeholders can explore the data and charts dynamically.
